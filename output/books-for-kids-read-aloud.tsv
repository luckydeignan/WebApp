0	4460	The Three Little Pigs by Dara Goldman
5640	9980	Once upon a time there were three little pigs,
11260	13480	Poki, Lazy, and Will.
15180	18800	One sunny morning they said goodbye to their mama and papa
18800	21560	and set off to build homes of their own.
22980	26940	Poki didn't like to work hard, so he built his house out of straw,
26940	29860	and then he had time to play all day long.
31800	35580	Lazy didn't like to work hard either. He built his house out of twigs,
36120	38320	and he had time to play all day too.
40060	42740	But Will worked very, very hard.
43180	47340	He built his house out of bricks. It took a long, long time,
47560	50400	but the little house was solid and sturdy.
51860	55300	One day, not long after the pigs had built their homes,
55300	60200	a big, bad wolf came along. He knocked on Poki's door.
61980	64500	Little pig, little pig, let me come in, he said.
65340	68620	Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin, said Poki.
69240	74300	Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down, said the wolf.
75720	80040	And he huffed and he puffed and he blew that straw house down.
80860	82580	Poki ran away just in time.
82700	85200	He didn't stop running until he reached Lazy's house.
86480	88940	But the big, bad wolf followed Poki.
89460	91120	He knocked on Lazy's door.
93580	97100	Little pig, little pigs, let me come in, he said.
98320	101600	Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chins, said Poki and Lazy.
102380	105420	Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow
105420	107340	your house down, said the wolf.
108460	111880	And he huffed and he puffed and he blew the twig house down.
111880	115880	Poki and Lazy ran through the blowing twigs and headed
115880	120100	straight to Will's house. But the big, bad wolf
120100	123100	followed the two pigs to their brother's little brick house.
123740	125100	He knocked on Will's door.
128100	130880	Little pig, little pig, let me come in, he said.
132480	135820	Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chins, they said.
136660	139880	Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your
139880	144680	house down, said the wolf. And he huffed and he puffed
145260	147420	and he puffed and he huffed
148380	152000	but the big, bad wolf couldn't blow the brick house down.
153700	155720	Then the wolf had an idea.
156280	159280	He climbed up the top of the house and headed down the chimney.
159600	164060	Oh no! cried Poki and Lazy. But Will had an idea
164060	168680	too. The big, bad wolf fell right in the middle of a boiling pot of
168680	170360	soup. Yow!
171740	176700	Yow! Yow! Yow! Yow! Yow! cried the big, bad wolf. He jumped out of the pot
176700	179900	and ran away from the little brick house as fast as he could.
180880	184560	And the big, bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs
184560	187220	again. The end.
