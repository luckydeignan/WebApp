The Three Little Pigs by Dara Goldman

00:05.640 --> 00:09.980
Once upon a time there were three little pigs,

00:11.260 --> 00:13.480
Poki, Lazy, and Will.

00:15.180 --> 00:18.800
One sunny morning they said goodbye to their mama and papa

00:18.800 --> 00:21.560
and set off to build homes of their own.

00:22.980 --> 00:26.940
Poki didn't like to work hard, so he built his house out of straw,

00:26.940 --> 00:29.860
and then he had time to play all day long.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.580
Lazy didn't like to work hard either. He built his house out of twigs,

00:36.120 --> 00:38.320
and he had time to play all day too.

00:40.060 --> 00:42.740
But Will worked very, very hard.

00:43.180 --> 00:47.340
He built his house out of bricks. It took a long, long time,

00:47.560 --> 00:50.400
but the little house was solid and sturdy.

00:51.860 --> 00:55.300
One day, not long after the pigs had built their homes,

00:55.300 --> 01:00.200
a big, bad wolf came along. He knocked on Poki's door.

01:01.980 --> 01:04.500
Little pig, little pig, let me come in, he said.

01:05.340 --> 01:08.620
Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin, said Poki.

01:09.240 --> 01:14.300
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down, said the wolf.

01:15.720 --> 01:20.040
And he huffed and he puffed and he blew that straw house down.

01:20.860 --> 01:22.580
Poki ran away just in time.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.200
He didn't stop running until he reached Lazy's house.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.940
But the big, bad wolf followed Poki.

01:29.460 --> 01:31.120
He knocked on Lazy's door.

01:33.580 --> 01:37.100
Little pig, little pigs, let me come in, he said.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.600
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chins, said Poki and Lazy.

01:42.380 --> 01:45.420
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow

01:45.420 --> 01:47.340
your house down, said the wolf.

01:48.460 --> 01:51.880
And he huffed and he puffed and he blew the twig house down.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.880
Poki and Lazy ran through the blowing twigs and headed

01:55.880 --> 02:00.100
straight to Will's house. But the big, bad wolf

02:00.100 --> 02:03.100
followed the two pigs to their brother's little brick house.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.100
He knocked on Will's door.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.880
Little pig, little pig, let me come in, he said.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.820
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chins, they said.

02:16.660 --> 02:19.880
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your

02:19.880 --> 02:24.680
house down, said the wolf. And he huffed and he puffed

02:25.260 --> 02:27.420
and he puffed and he huffed

02:28.380 --> 02:32.000
but the big, bad wolf couldn't blow the brick house down.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.720
Then the wolf had an idea.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.280
He climbed up the top of the house and headed down the chimney.

02:39.600 --> 02:44.060
Oh no! cried Poki and Lazy. But Will had an idea

02:44.060 --> 02:48.680
too. The big, bad wolf fell right in the middle of a boiling pot of

02:48.680 --> 02:50.360
soup. Yow!

02:51.740 --> 02:56.700
Yow! Yow! Yow! Yow! Yow! cried the big, bad wolf. He jumped out of the pot

02:56.700 --> 02:59.900
and ran away from the little brick house as fast as he could.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.560
And the big, bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs

03:04.560 --> 03:07.220
again. The end.
