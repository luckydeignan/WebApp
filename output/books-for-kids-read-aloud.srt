The Three Little Pigs by Dara Goldman

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,980
Once upon a time there were three little pigs,

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,480
Poki, Lazy, and Will.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,800
One sunny morning they said goodbye to their mama and papa

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,560
and set off to build homes of their own.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,940
Poki didn't like to work hard, so he built his house out of straw,

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,860
and then he had time to play all day long.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,580
Lazy didn't like to work hard either. He built his house out of twigs,

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,320
and he had time to play all day too.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,740
But Will worked very, very hard.

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,340
He built his house out of bricks. It took a long, long time,

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,400
but the little house was solid and sturdy.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,300
One day, not long after the pigs had built their homes,

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,200
a big, bad wolf came along. He knocked on Poki's door.

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,500
Little pig, little pig, let me come in, he said.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,620
Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin, said Poki.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,300
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down, said the wolf.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,040
And he huffed and he puffed and he blew that straw house down.

19
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,580
Poki ran away just in time.

20
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,200
He didn't stop running until he reached Lazy's house.

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,940
But the big, bad wolf followed Poki.

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,120
He knocked on Lazy's door.

23
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,100
Little pig, little pigs, let me come in, he said.

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,600
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chins, said Poki and Lazy.

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,420
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,340
your house down, said the wolf.

27
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,880
And he huffed and he puffed and he blew the twig house down.

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Poki and Lazy ran through the blowing twigs and headed

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,100
straight to Will's house. But the big, bad wolf

30
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,100
followed the two pigs to their brother's little brick house.

31
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,100
He knocked on Will's door.

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,880
Little pig, little pig, let me come in, he said.

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,820
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chins, they said.

34
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,880
Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,680
house down, said the wolf. And he huffed and he puffed

36
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,420
and he puffed and he huffed

37
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,000
but the big, bad wolf couldn't blow the brick house down.

38
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,720
Then the wolf had an idea.

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,280
He climbed up the top of the house and headed down the chimney.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,060
Oh no! cried Poki and Lazy. But Will had an idea

41
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,680
too. The big, bad wolf fell right in the middle of a boiling pot of

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,360
soup. Yow!

43
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,700
Yow! Yow! Yow! Yow! Yow! cried the big, bad wolf. He jumped out of the pot

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,900
and ran away from the little brick house as fast as he could.

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,560
And the big, bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,220
again. The end.
