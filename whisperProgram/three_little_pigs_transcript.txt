upon
a
time
there
were
three
little
pigs
pokey
lazy
and

one
sunny
morning
they
said
goodbye
to
their
mama
and
papa
and
set
off
to
build
homes
of
their
own
pokey
didn't
like
to
work
hard
so
he
built
his
house
out
of
straw
and
then
he
had
time
to
play
all
day
long
lazy
didn't
like
to
work
hard
either
he
built
his
house
out
of
twigs
and
he
had
time
to
play
all
day
too
but
will
worked
very
very
hard
he
built
his
house
out
of
bricks
it
took
a
long
long
time
but
the
little
house
was
solid
and
sturdy
one
day
not
long
after
the
pigs
had
built
their
homes
a
big
bad
wolf
came
along
he
knocked
on
pokey's
door
little
pig
little
pig
let
me
come
in
he
said
not
by
the
hair
on
my
chinny-chin-chin
said
pokey
then
i'll
huff
and
i'll
puff
and
i'll
blow
your
house
down
said
the
wolf
and
he
huffed
and
he
puffed
and
he
blew
that
straw
house
down
pokey
ran
away
just
in
time
he
didn't
stop
running
until
he
reached
lazy's
house
but
the
big
bad
wolf
followed
pokey
he
knocked
on
lazy's
door
little
pig
little
pigs
let
me
come
in
he
said
not
by
the
hairs
on
my
chinny
chin

said
pokey
and
lazy
then
i'll
huff
and
i'll

said
the
wolf
and
he
huffed
and
he
puffed
and
he
blew
the
twig
house
down
pokey
and
lazy
ran
through
the
blowing
twigs
and
headed
straight
to
will's
house
but
the
big
bad
wolf
followed
the
two
pigs
to
their
brother's
little
brick
house
he
knocked
on
will's
door
little
pigs
little

let
me
come

he
said
not
by
the

said
the

huffed
and
he
puffed
and
he
puffed
and
he
huffed
but
the
big
bad
wolf
couldn't
blow
the
brick
house
down
then
the
wolf
had
an
idea
he
climbed
up
the
top
of
the
house
and
headed
down
the
chimney
oh

cried
pokey
and
lazy
but
will
had
an
idea
too
the
big
bad
wolf
fell
right
in
the
middle
of
a
boiling
pot
of
soup
Ow
Ow
Ow!
cried
the
big
bad
wolf
he
jumped
out
of
the
pot
and
ran
away
from
the
little
brick
house
as
fast
as
he
could
and
the
big
bad
wolf
never
bothered
the
three
little
pigs
again
the
end
